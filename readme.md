One of the first areas of exploration for the [NJC fellowship](http://njc.codeforaustralia.org) was around access to court documents, currently documents such as court dates, summons and intervention orders are printed and either physically handed to clients or sent by mail. We decided to focus on was Personal safety and Family violence intervention orders. These are legal documents with specific terms used to outline the conditions of the order, respondents are expected to understand the terms of the order to ensure they can avoid a breach, and affected members are also required to understand them in the event that a breach does occur and police or other authorities need to be notified.

We wanted to provide a simple, accessible option for clients to have easy access to an up to date copy of this order. In the event of the terms of the order changing, we wanted clients to be able to access the most up to date information whenever they needed it.
